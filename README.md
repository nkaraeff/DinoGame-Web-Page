Overview

This project includes optional hardware integration using an Arduino board to enhance the gameplay experience through external physical input.

The Arduino device communicates with the web application via serial communication, enabling real-time control of game actions.

--Hardware Setup

Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)

USB serial communication

External input component (e.g., button or sensor)

--Communication Flow
Arduino → Serial Communication → Web Application → Game Action

The Arduino sends signals via the serial port, which are captured and processed by the application to trigger in-game events (such as jump actions).

--Purpose

This integration demonstrates:

Embedded systems fundamentals

Hardware-software interaction

Real-time input processing

Serial communication handling
